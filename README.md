### Important Info
Do not delete or move any files that are inside this zip/folder, instead just pin the TsundOku.exe file to your taskbar or start menu or create a copy for your desktop.

If you lose or delete the UserData.dat file u will lose your entire collection, so do not delete it, u will have to start over again, the Covers folder I also made visible incase u want to change the img shown for a particular series just make sure u copy the EXACT name and extension (either JPG or PNG) from the image file.

### HOW TO DOWNLOAD A JVM/JDK & UPDATE YOUR SYSTEM VARIABLES (WITHOUT A JVM/JDK YOU CAN NOT RUN ANY JAVA APPLICATIONS)
1.  *Go to this link (https://jdk.java.net/16/) and download the appropiate folder (.zip for Windows) for your OS*
    

2. *Unzip the folder and move the unzipped folder to preferably your Program Files folder in your C.\ drive (I would rec creating a Java folder in there and putting the unzipped folder in there but it really doesn't matter)*


3. *COPY THE PATH TO THE JDK -> It should be something like this "C.\Program Files\Java\jdk-16.0.1"*


4. *Search in Windows "Edit the environment Variables" and run -> Click "Environment Variables" at the bottom right*


5. *At the top left under "User variables for {your machine name}" click new and type in "JAVA_HOME" for the "Variable Name" and paste the path from step 3 that points to your jdk folder for "Variable Value" -> then hit "OK"*


6. *Under the same section "User variables for {your machine name}" find the variable name "path", click on it then press "Edit..", then at the top right click "New" and enter into the field "%JAVA_HOME%\bin" -> then click "OK" on every window until it exits*


7. *To ensure it works open your terminal or powershell and type "echo %JAVA_HOME%" to ensure it is grabbing the path correctly, it should print the path to the console window that copied from 3. Then type in "java -version" and it should print out the version, runtime environment, and Server VM on 3 seperate lines. If both of those worked then everything is set up correctly*
